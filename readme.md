# Upload server

Very simple http-server to upload files and folders to the host

## TODO

- [x] Add unicode support
- [x] Add a progress bar
  - [x] Progress bar uses socket io so some edges needed to be cut but it works
- [x] Use a tiny css framework
- [x] Can't upload big files, needs more testing
  - [x] It depends on the network and not the server
- [ ] Add a way to browse the servers recieved directory
- [ ] Make a npm package so that i can install it on more platforms
